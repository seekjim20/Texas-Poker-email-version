# Texas-Poker-email-version

I was playing Texas Poker one day, and felt lazy to shuffle and distribute the cards, and therefore thought of making an email version.

This program automatically shuffles the deck, and distribute the private cards to each player through email. The main program will also step you through the game.

This program uses the python default random module for shuffling, and does not guarantee any true randomness or fairness of the game.

This program also does not replace the physical table where players all sit around, with poker chips, tasty snacks, trash talk, all the usual. That's where the fun is, isn't it?
