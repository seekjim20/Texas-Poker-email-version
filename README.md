# Texas-Poker-email-version
I was playing Texas Poker one day, and felt lazy to shuffle and distribute the cards, and therefore thought of making an email version.

This program automatically shuffles the card, distribute to players through email. The main program will also prompt you to continue the game.

One still needs the players in the same physical table, with poker chips, and trash talk, all the usual. That's where the fun is, isn't it?
